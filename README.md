# Two simple Bitcoin scripts to learn P2SH and P2PKH transactions.

Script 1:
Create a P2SH Bitcoin address where all funds sent to it should be locked until a specific time specified either by block height or UNIX Epoch time.

Use Bitcoin Core to create multiple funding transactions to that P2SH address.

Script 2:
Send all funds that the P2SH address received to the P2PKH address provided.
